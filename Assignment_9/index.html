        <h2>Bread Recipe</h2>
        <p>In a mixing bowl, combine 100 milliliters of warm water with the instant yeast. Mix this with half of the flour (325 grams), sugar, salt, and room temperature butter. Stir until combined.</p>
        <p>Add the remaining 300 milliliters of water and the rest of the flour (325 grams) to the mixture. Stir with a dough whisk until a shaggy dough forms.</p>
        <p>Turn the dough out onto a floured countertop and knead for 7-9 minutes until it becomes smooth and supple.</p>
        <p>Generously oil a large bowl and place the dough inside. Roll it around to coat it evenly with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</p>
        <p>After rising, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured countertop, punch it down to its original size, and start forming it into a loaf. Tuck it under itself to create a round top.</p>
        <p>Place the shaped dough in a loaf pan prepared with butter and parchment paper. Cover it loosely with plastic wrap and let it rise for another hour, or until it has doubled in size once again.</p>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and brush the dough with a bit of butter.</p>
        <p>Bake the bread in the preheated oven for 25-35 minutes. Set a timer if needed.</p>
        <p>Once baked, brush the freshly baked loaf with melted butter. Allow it to cool and set aside for breakfast.</p>
        <p>Disclaimer: The bread making process used by Babish was learned in Vermont, but for simplicity, you can use store-bought bread.</p>

        <h2>Eggs in a Nest Instructions</h2>
        <p>Start by taking the thick slice of bread and cutting out the center to create a hole in the middle. You can use a glass or a mason jar for this, but cutting it out preserves the center for later use.</p>
        <p>In a stainless steel skillet, melt 1.5 tablespoons (45 grams) of butter over medium-low heat. Make sure to coat both sides of the bread thoroughly with the melted butter.</p>
        <p>Place the buttered bread in the skillet and let it cook for about 2 minutes on medium-low heat. This should be approximately the length of one of your favorite songs.</p>
        <p>For some added flavor, you can add a small amount of bacon fat to the center of the bread. Then, crack an egg into the hole in the bread.</p>
        <p>Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for about 1 minute or the duration of 84 snaps in a song. Flip the bread with the egg carefully.</p>
        <p>Add a yolk mopper (a separate piece of bread or toast) to the skillet and continue cooking for no more than 10-15 seconds.</p>
        <p>Season your Eggs in a Nest with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>Use a fork and knife to serve and enjoy your delicious Eggs in a Nest.</p>
