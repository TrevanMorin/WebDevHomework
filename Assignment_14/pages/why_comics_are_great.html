        <h2>Why Comics Are Great</h2>
        <p>
            Comics are a unique and powerful form of storytelling that combines visual art and narrative. The combination of illustrations and text allows for a rich, immersive experience, engaging readers in ways traditional literature cannot. Through the years, comics have evolved from simple strips to complex graphic novels, covering a wide range of genres and themes. Their accessibility and visual appeal make them a compelling medium for storytelling. The success of comics is evident in their influence on other media, with numerous adaptations into movies, TV shows, and video games. The ability to convey intricate narratives and evoke emotional responses has solidified comics as a vibrant and enduring art form.
