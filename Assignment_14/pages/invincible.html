            "Invincible" is a superhero comic series by Robert Kirkman, telling the story of Mark Grayson, a teenager who discovers he has superpowers inherited from his father, Omni-Man. Debuting in 2003, the series gained widespread acclaim for its fresh take on superhero tropes and character-driven narrative. "Invincible" also made its mark in other media, with discussions about a film adaptation. Its success contributed to Kirkman's reputation and furthered the popularity of non-mainstream superhero stories.
