            "The Boys," created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, provides a dark, satirical take on the superhero genre. First published by Wildstorm and later Dynamite Entertainment, the series gained popularity for its subversive storytelling and exploration of the consequences of unchecked superhero power. Its success led to a highly successful TV adaptation on Amazon Prime Video, turning "The Boys" into a cultural phenomenon. The series expanded into video games, merchandise, and discussions about potential spin-offs.
